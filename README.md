# pull-request-tutorial
Instructions for creating a PR (non-technical staff)

## Introduction
This tutorial is meant to teach basic understanding of how a pull request is
made ...

## Stage, commit, and push

## Instructions
A student may require your help in making a pull request after their assessment.
1. Ask the student to go to their terminal and enter the repo they were working
on.
2. Ask the student to do a `git status`
3. You should either see the following in the terminal:
* "Nothing to commit..." (go to step #)
* "Changes to commit..." (go to step #)
* Changes not staged for commit (go to step 4)
4. If the student has not staged their changes, ask them to to a
`git add [FILE-NAME]` or a `git add .` to add *all* files.
5. Ask the student to do a git status. You should now see "Changes to be
committed" on the terminal. If not, repeat step 3 until all files have been
added.
6. Ask the student to type `git commit` to their terminal. Their text editor
should open up, and that's where they will add their commit message.
7. Save and quit the text editor after committing.
8. Go back to the terminal.
